Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
</b></h1><hr>
<pre><h3><font color="blue" size="5px">
Sustainable consumption and production is about promoting resource and energy efficiency, sustainable infrastructure, 
and providing access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all. Its implementation 
helps to achieve overall development plans, reduce future economic, environmental and social costs, strengthen economic 
competitiveness and reduce poverty.
Sustainable consumption and production  aims at “doing more and better with less,” increasing net welfare gains from 
economic activities by reducing resource use, degradation and pollution along the whole lifecycle, while increasing 
quality of life. It involves different stakeholders, including business, consumers, policy makers, researchers, scientists,
retailers, media, and development cooperation agencies, among others.
It also requires a systemic approach and cooperation among actors operating in the supply chain, from producer to final
consumer.It involves engaging consumers through awareness-raising and education on sustainable consumption and lifestyles, 
providing consumers with adequate information through standards and labels and engaging in sustainable public procurement, 
among others.
