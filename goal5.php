While the world has achieved progress towards gender equality  and women's empowerment under the
Millennium Development Goals (including equal access to primary education between girls and boys),
women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world.
Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, 
prosperous and sustainable world.
Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation 
in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies 
and humanity at large.
<h1><font color="black">Goals Targets</font></h1>
1) End all forms of discrimination against all women and girls everywhere.<br/>
2) Eliminate all forms of violence against all women and girls in the public and private spheres,
     including trafficking and sexual and other types of exploitation.<br/>
3) Eliminate all harmful practices, such as child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation.<br/>
4) Recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services, 
    infrastructure and social protection policies and the promotion of shared responsibility 
    within the household and the family as nationally appropriate.<br/>
