Goal 4: Ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning
</b></h1><hr>

<pre><h3><font color="blue" size="5px">
Obtaining a quality education is the foundation to improving people’s lives and sustainable development.
Major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment
rates in schools particularly for women and girls. Basic literacy skills have improved tremendously, yet 
bolder efforts are needed to make even greater strides for achieving universal education goals. For example,
the world has achieved equality in primary education between girls and boys, but few countries have achieved
that target at all levels of education.
