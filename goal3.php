Ensuring healthy lives and promoting the well-being for all at all ages is essential to sustainable development. 
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated
with child and maternal mortality. Major progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation,
reducing malaria, tuberculosis, polio and the spread of HIV/AIDS. However, many more efforts are needed to fully 
eradicate a wide range of diseases and address many different persistent and emerging health issues.
<br/>

1) By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.<br/>
2) By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries
   aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 
   mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.<br/>
3) By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat
