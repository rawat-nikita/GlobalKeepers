God has gifted us with such a beautiful planet which gives us almost everything for our comfort.</br>
We are lucky enough to be living in the only planet of the Universe.We have fresh air, clean water,<br/> 
healthy communities and life all around us.<br/>
But we human beings are so selfish that in order to fulfill our needs we are destroying our planet.<br/>
We dont understand that everyone of us is responsible for the future of all of us.<br/>
We need to make it our personal agenda to change the world.Since we are so much dependent on social media <br/>
and technology we can use it as a powerful unifying tool.<br/>
<b>We have to believe that best is yet to come and we don't need more aid,we need better aid.</b><br/>
Luckily, we still have things in our hands.<br/>
<br>
In 2015, The United Nations came up with a plan, and called them the Sustainable Development Goals, or the Global Goals.<br/>
These are aimed to eradicate, or atleast reduce the 17 major problems that the world is facing. They aimed to implement <br/>
this plan for the next 15 years, and make Earth a sustainable planet.<br/>
But the <b>UN</b> cannot do it  alone.<br/>
The 17 goals will not solve the problem, but more and more people acting towards them will surely do.<br/>
