<pre><h3><font color="blue">
Extreme poverty rates have been cut by more than half since 1990. While this is a remarkable achievement, one in
five people in developing regions still live on less than $1.25 a day, and there are millions more who make little 
more than this daily amount, plus many people risk slipping back into poverty.
Poverty is more than the lack of income and resources to ensure a sustainable livelihood. Its manifestations include
hunger and malnutrition, limited access to education and other basic services, social discrimination and exclusion as 
well as the lack of participation in decision-making. Economic growth must be inclusive to provide sustainable jobs 
and promote equality.</h3>
