Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the world faces today. Be it for 
jobs, security, climate change, food production or increasing incomes, access to energy for all is essential.
Sustainable energy is opportunity-it transforms lives, economies and the planet.

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is leading a Sustainable Energy for All initiative to ensure universal access
to modern energy services, improve efficiency and increase use of renewable sources.

2) By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix.<br/>
3) By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.<br/>
4) By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean energy research and technology,
    including renewable energy, energy efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote
