Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources

The world's oceans-their temperature, chemistry, currents and life-drive global systems
that make the Earth habitable for humankind.
Our rainwater, drinking water, weather, climate, coastlines, much of our food, and even 
the oxygen in the air we breathe, are all ultimately provided and regulated by the sea. 
Throughout history, oceans and seas have been vital conduits for trade and transportation.
Careful management of this essential global resource is a key feature of a sustainable 
future.

<h1><font color="black">Goal Targets</font></h1>
1) By 2025, prevent and significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, in particular from land-
     based activities, including marine debris and nutrient pollution.<br/>
2) By 2020, sustainably manage and protect marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse 
    impacts, including by strengthening their resilience, and take action for their restoration in 
    order to achieve healthy and productive oceans.<br/>
3) Minimize and address the impacts of ocean acidification, including through enhanced scientific cooperation 
    at all levels.<br/>
4) By 2020, effectively regulate harvesting and end overfishing, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and 
    destructive fishing practices and implement science-based management plans, in order to restore fish 
    stocks in the shortest time feasible, at least to levels that can produce maximum sustainable yield 
    as determined by their biological characteristics.<br/>
4) By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent with national and international 
    law and based on the best available scientific information.<br/>
5) By 2020, prohibit certain forms of fisheries subsidies which contribute to overcapacity and overfishing, 
    eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and refrain from 
    introducing new such subsidies, recognizing that appropriate and effective special and differential 
    treatment for developing and least developed countries should be an integral part of the World Trade 
    Organization fisheries subsidies negotiation.<br/>
6) By 2030, increase the economic benefits to Small Island developing States and least developed countries 
    from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through sustainable management of fisheries, 
    aquaculture and tourism.<br/>
7) Increase scientific knowledge, develop research capacity and transfer marine technology, taking into 
     account the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission Criteria and Guidelines on the Transfer of 
     Marine Technology, in order to improve ocean health and to enhance the contribution of marine
     biodiversity to the development of developing countries, in particular small island developing 
     States and least developed countries.
