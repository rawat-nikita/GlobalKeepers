Cities are hubs for ideas, commerce, culture, science, productivity, social development and much more. At their 
best, cities have enabled people to advance socially and economically.
However, many challenges exist to maintaining cities in a way that continues to create jobs and prosperity while
not straining land and resources. Common urban challenges include congestion, lack of funds to provide basic services, 
a shortage of adequate housing and declining infrastructure.
The challenges cities face can be overcome in ways that allow them to continue to thrive and grow, while improving 
resource use and reducing pollution and poverty. The future we want includes cities of opportunities for all, with 
access to basic services, energy, housing, transportation and more.
