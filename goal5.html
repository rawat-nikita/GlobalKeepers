Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls
</b></h1><hr>

<pre><h3><font color="blue" size="5px">
While the world has achieved progress towards gender equality  and women’s empowerment under the
Millennium Development Goals (including equal access to primary education between girls and boys),
women and girls continue to suffer discrimination and violence in every part of the world.
Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, 
prosperous and sustainable world.
Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation 
in political and economic decision-making processes will fuel sustainable economies and benefit societies 
and humanity at large.
