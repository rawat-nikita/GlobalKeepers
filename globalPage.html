The Global Goals will be adopted by 193 world leaders at the UN’s annual <br/>
General Assembly – the main gathering of the United Nations.

These new goals build on the progress of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) <br/>
set in 2000 – which have helped to halve poverty and improve living standards <br/>
around 
the world over the past 15 years.

The aim of the Global Goals – also called the Sustainable Development Goals – 
is to finish the job of the MDGs over the next 15 years.</font>
