Goal 13: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

<pre><h3><font color="blue" size="5px">
Climate change is now affecting every country on every continent. It is disrupting national economies and 
affecting lives, costing people, communities and countries dearly today and even more tomorrow.
People are experiencing the significant impacts of climate change, which include changing weather patterns, 
rising sea level, and more extreme weather events. The greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are 
driving climate change and continue to rise. They are now at their highest levels in history. Without action, 
the world’s average surface temperature is projected to rise over the 21st century and is likely to surpass 3 
degrees Celsius this century—with some areas of the world expected to warm even more. The poorest and most 
vulnerable people are being affected the most.
Affordable, scalable solutions are now available to enable countries to leapfrog to cleaner, more resilient economies. 
The pace of change is quickening as more people are turning to renewable energy and a range of other measures that will
reduce emissions and increase adaptation efforts.
But climate change is a global challenge that does not respect national borders. Emissions anywhere affect people 
everywhere. It is an issue that requires solutions that need to be coordinated at the international level and it 
requires international cooperation to help developing countries move toward a low-carbon economy.
<br/>
<h1><font color="black">Goal Targets</font></h1>
1) Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.
2) Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.
3) Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation,
     impact reduction and early warning.
4) Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on
     Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the 
     needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation 
     and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible.
5) Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed
      countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities.
